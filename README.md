# Microcontroller power management

Developed a system with multiple power modes: Active, Modem Sleep, Light Sleep, and Deep Sleep, controlling power consumption and system behavior across different states.
Utilized a rotary encoder connected to GPIO25, GPIO26, and GPIO27 for detecting rotation and button presses, which interact with the systemâ€™s modes.
Implemented Bluetooth communication using the BluetoothSerial.h library to accept commands for controlling LED, sleep modes, and more:
Commands include turning the LED on/off, switching between various sleep modes, and waking up from low-power states.
Configured touch buttons on GPIO12 and GPIO14 for triggering modem-sleep, light-sleep, and deep-sleep modes, responding to user input via the touchRead() function.
LED control connected to GPIO13, responding to Bluetooth commands to toggle on/off states.
Designed a wake-up mechanism with a button on GPIO2 to wake up the system from light-sleep and deep-sleep modes.
# Managed four power modes:
## Active Mode: Full processor and peripheral functionality, supporting rotary encoder detection, Bluetooth communication, and LED control.
## Modem Sleep Mode: Processor and peripherals remain active, with reduced power consumption while allowing Bluetooth communication.
## Light Sleep Mode: CPU suspended, with no Bluetooth communication or rotary encoder input, but state is maintained for wake-up.
## Deep Sleep Mode: RTC memory retains data, and only essential values persist, allowing for ultra-low power consumption.
